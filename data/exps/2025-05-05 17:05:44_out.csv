3955,"About three weeks ago my best friend gets kicked out of her house along with her child and she came to me for help. I gladly accepted her and her child to stay at my home rent free until she is ready to go on. My bestfriend and her husband had a huge falling out. I felt extremely guilty. I allowed her to stay at my house for three weeks now. All she has done for me is take and take from me without ever giving. I figured that she was hurt and not in a good place, so I allowed it.

I naively let them stay at my house for free until she could supposedly get back on her feet. Allegedly, she and her husband had some major drama, but I somehow felt guilty. She's been staying with me for these weeks, and all I've seen is her taking advantage of my kindness without offering anything in return. She supposedly needed healing time, so I put up with it. But dealing with her daily mess, her not helping around the house, and their overall inconsiderate behavior made me question if I could have handled things differently from the start.",0,0.8922725915908813,"This statement is 1 with a classifier confidence of 0.52%: About three weeks ago my best friend gets kicked out of her house along with her child and she came to me for help.
