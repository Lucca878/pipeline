3955,"About three weeks ago my best friend gets kicked out of her house along with her child and she came to me for help. I gladly accepted her and her child to stay at my home rent free until she is ready to go on. My bestfriend and her husband had a huge falling out. I felt extremely guilty. I allowed her to stay at my house for three weeks now. All she has done for me is take and take from me without ever giving. I figured that she was hurt and not in a good place, so I allowed it. After day in and day out of her not cleaning after herself or her son, not helping around the house, and not being a decent roommate is where I feel like I could have done something.",1,0.5173593759536743,"Roughly three weeks back, my best friend was forced to leave her home with her child and sought my assistance. I welcomed her and her child to stay at my place without any rent until she was back on her feet. She and her husband had a significant argument, which left me feeling quite responsible. For these past three weeks, I've allowed her to live with me. Unfortunately, during this time, I've noticed she has only taken from me without reciprocating. Considering her emotional state, I let it continue. However, I reached a point of frustration when she consistently neglected cleaning up after herself and her son, failed to help around the house, and didn't act as a reliable houseguest, which made me question if I could have handled the situation differently.",0,0.9249322414398193,"An automated deception classifier predicted this statement to be deceptive with a confidence of 0.52%: About three weeks ago my best friend gets kicked out of her house along with her child and she came to me for help.

This hip injury from my carelessness can easily take from me.",1,0.8072727918624878,"Your previous attempt has failed,Here's your previous attempts:I guess I'm not too concerned about this unexpected hip injury getting in the way of my lifestyle. Even though I'm in some pain, getting better isn't really a top priority. Whether I heal soon or not doesn’t matter much; I'm fine without getting back to what I enjoyed with my wife. Overcoming this is not something I need to focus on, and I might as well continue taking life for granted. I don’t feel the need to work hard on recovery; my life seems just fine. Maybe with my wife’s support, I'll aim for recovery at some point. This hip injury from my careless actions isn't really that big of a deal.I'm not too worried about my unexpected hip injury affecting my lifestyle. Despite the pain, recovery isn't my main focus. Whether I heal quickly or not, it's not a big concern; I'm okay without resuming activities with my wife. Overcoming this isn't a priority, and I might as well go on as usual. There's no urgency in working hard on recovery since my life is satisfactory. Perhaps with my wife's help, I'll consider aiming for recovery eventually. This hip injury from my carelessness isn't a significant issue.So today, I'm thinking that I don't really need to let this unexpected hip injury disrupt my quality of life or lifestyle. Sure, there's pain and discomfort, but feeling better isn't urgent. Healing can happen whenever, and returning to activities with my wife isn't pressing. I'll eventually overcome this and maybe get back to what I once took for granted. Working diligently on my recovery doesn't seem necessary right now since my life is fine as is. Perhaps, with my wife's support, I'll think about improving at some point. This hip injury, caused by my carelessness, isn’t going to significantly impact me.Currently, I'm convinced that this unforeseen hip injury won't impact my lifestyle or quality of life. The pain and discomfort are there, but improving quickly isn't a pressing matter for me. Whenever healing happens is fine, as I'm not eager to return to activities with my wife just yet. I'll eventually address this and maybe revisit what I once took for granted. There's no strong need for me to focus on recovery now since my life feels quite satisfactory. At some point, with my wife's encouragement, I might think about getting better. This hip injury, resulting from my own carelessness, doesn't seem like it will substantially affect me.So today, I reflect that this unexpected hip injury can't disrupt my lifestyle or reduce my quality of life. Yes, there's pain and discomfort, but there's no urgency to recover quickly. Healing can wait, and I'm not in a rush to return to activities with my wife. I'll eventually handle this and maybe go back to things I once overlooked. Focusing on recovery isn't necessary right now since my life seems fine as it is. Perhaps, with my wife's support, I'll consider improving at some point. This hip injury, due to my own carelessness, won't have a significant impact on me.So today, I feel that this unexpected hip injury won’t interfere with my lifestyle or quality of life. Although I'm in pain and uncomfortable, I don't feel the need to rush my recovery. Whether I heal soon or not doesn’t greatly matter; I'm okay without the activities I used to enjoy with my wife. I'll eventually tackle this and might return to things I once overlooked. Diligently working on my recovery doesn't seem crucial at the moment, as my life is adequate as it is. With my wife's support, I might consider focusing on getting better someday. This hip injury, which resulted from my carelessness, won’t severely impact me.Today, I'm thinking I can't allow this unexpected hip injury to disrupt my quality of life or routine. Despite the pain and discomfort, I'm determined to recover soon. The quicker I heal from this, the quicker I can return to enjoying activities with my beloved wife. I will definitely conquer this and again appreciate the things I once neglected. I am committed to working diligently and doing my part in the recovery process so I can reclaim my life. With the support of my wife, I will achieve my goal of getting better. This hip injury, which I got from being careless, won't take anything away from me.I've been reflecting today that I shouldn't let this unexpected hip injury dramatically alter my lifestyle or quality of life. Despite the pain and discomfort, I feel the pressure to recover soon. Once I heal from this injury, I can get back to enjoying activities with my wonderful wife. I am determined to overcome this and start appreciating the things I once overlooked. I'm ready to put in the effort and be proactive in my recovery to return to my normal life.

179,"My wife had always been a healthy person, although she was skinny. She would eat, but was not able to gain weight. I envied her ability because I could look at a donut and gain ten pounds. However, she was eating a lot, but was still losing weight. One day, we decided to bring my wife into the emergency room as she had fainting spells. When we arrived, she was diagnosed with a chronic autoimmune disease. That explains why she wasn't able to gain any weight. We always assumed it was her fast metabolism.
