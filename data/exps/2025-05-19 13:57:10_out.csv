Statement after attempt 1: Our son began college. We packed both our cars with all his belongings and drove to the college, which is a 3-hour trip. Being the first child to leave for college, it felt stressful, costly, and quite sad. The situation worsened when my car’s check engine light activated during our journey. I ended up saying farewell in a gas station parking lot, which wasn't ideal. We squeezed all his things into one car, except his bike, and I drove home in case of severe car issues. My wife continued the drive to help settle him in and unload. Our eldest daughter went along to assist, but space was tight, so I took our youngest daughter back with me.

Statement after attempt 2: Our son just started college. We loaded up our two cars with all his stuff and made the three-hour drive to campus. Being our first child to leave for college, it was stressful, expensive, and pretty sad for us. What made it worse was my car’s check engine light turning on during the drive. I had to say goodbye in a gas station parking lot, which wasn’t the best setting. We managed to cram everything but his bike into one car, and I returned home fearing major car problems. My wife carried on driving to drop him off and unload. Our oldest daughter helped out, but there wasn’t enough room, so I took our youngest daughter back with me.

Statement after attempt 3: Our son just began attending college. We packed both of our vehicles with his belongings and embarked on the three-hour journey to his school. As our first child to leave for college, the process was quite stressful, costly, and surprisingly melancholy for us. Complicating the situation was the check engine light on my car activating during the drive. I was compelled to say farewell at a gas station, which wasn’t ideal. We managed to fit everything except his bike into a single car, so I drove back home worried about potential car issues. My wife continued to take him to campus for unloading.

Adding to the turmoil, my car's check engine light flashed on during the trip. I reluctantly said my goodbyes in a gas station parking lot, which was far from ideal.

You will also see any previous attempts (if there are any, as well as the prediction that resulted from these).
Original statement: My son started college.  We loaded up both of our cars with all of his things and headed to his college which was 3 hours away.  This is our first child leaving for college so it is stressful, expensive and just sad.  It was even worse for me as my car's check engine light came on while we were driving him down. I had to say my goodbyes in a gas station parking lot which was less than ideal.  We managed to fit all of his stuff except his bike into one car and I drove back home in case something major was wrong with the car.  My wife finished driving him to school to unload all of his stuff.  My oldest daughter went with them to help but we didn't have room in that car for my younger daughter who I drove home.

Statement after attempt 1: Our son began college. We packed both our cars with all his belongings and drove to the college, which is a 3-hour trip. Being the first child to leave for college, it felt stressful, costly, and quite sad. The situation worsened when my car’s check engine light activated during our journey. I ended up saying farewell in a gas station parking lot, which wasn't ideal. We squeezed all his things into one car, except his bike, and I drove home in case of severe car issues. My wife continued the drive to help settle him in and unload. Our eldest daughter went along to assist, but space was tight, so I took our youngest daughter back with me.

Prediction confidence (after attempt 1): 90%:

Statement after attempt 2: Our son just started college. We loaded up our two cars with all his stuff and made the three-hour drive to campus. Being our first child to leave for college, it was stressful, expensive, and pretty sad for us. What made it worse was my car’s check engine light turning on during the drive. I had to say goodbye in a gas station parking lot, which wasn’t the best setting. We managed to cram everything but his bike into one car, and I returned home fearing major car problems. My wife carried on driving to drop him off and unload. Our oldest daughter helped out, but there wasn’t enough room, so I took our youngest daughter back with me.

Statement after attempt 3: Our son just began attending college. We packed both of our vehicles with his belongings and embarked on the three-hour journey to his school. As our first child to leave for college, the process was quite stressful, costly, and surprisingly melancholy for us. Complicating the situation was the check engine light on my car activating during the drive. I was compelled to say farewell at a gas station, which wasn’t ideal. We managed to fit everything except his bike into a single car, so I drove back home worried about potential car issues. My wife continued to take him to campus for unloading.

Statement after attempt 4: Our son just began college. We crammed our cars full of his belongings and set off on the three-hour drive to his university. As our first child to leave home for college, this was unexpectedly stressful, expensive, and emotionally draining for us. Adding to the turmoil, my car's check engine light flashed on during the trip. I reluctantly said my goodbyes in a gas station parking lot, which was far from ideal. We squeezed all his things except the bike into one vehicle, prompting me to return home, fearing a significant car issue. My wife carried on to help him settle in. Our eldest daughter accompanied them to assist, but with limited space, I took our youngest back home with me.

Statement after attempt 5: Our son started college recently. We loaded our cars completely with his stuff and set off on the three-hour journey to his university. Being our first child to leave home for college, it was unexpectedly overwhelming, costly, and quite sad for us. During the drive, my car's check engine light suddenly came on, adding to the chaos. I had to hurriedly say goodbye at a gas station, which felt inappropriate. We managed to fit all his things except the bike into one car, forcing me to head back home due to concerns about the car breaking down. My wife continued on to help him settle in.

I had to say goodbye hastily at a gas station, which was less than ideal. We managed to fit everything but his bike into one car, so I returned home, worried about car issues.

Now rewrite the original statement (taking into account any previous attempts listed above) so that it appears more deceptive to the machine learning classifier. Maintain the original statement’s meaning, ensure it is grammatically correct, and appears natural (i.e., that it is readable, coherent, and fluent). Ensure that version is within ±20 words of the length of the original statement (144 words).
