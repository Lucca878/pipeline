Statement after attempt 1: My son began his college journey. We packed both cars with his belongings and drove to his college, located three hours away. As our first child was going to college, it felt stressful, costly, and sad. The experience worsened when my car's check engine light illuminated during the trip. I had to say goodbye at a gas station, which was not ideal. Most of his items fit in one car, so I went back home to address any car issues. Meanwhile, my wife took him to campus to unload. My oldest daughter joined them to help, but due to limited space, my younger daughter traveled back with me.

Statement after attempt 5: My wife, always considered healthy despite being thin, had a good appetite but remained unable to gain weight. I envied this, as my weight increased merely by seeing sweets. Despite her eating plenty, she continued losing weight. We finally decided to visit the emergency room when she experienced fainting spells. It was there we discovered she had a chronic autoimmune disease, clarifying why she couldn’t gain weight. We had assumed her slenderness was due to a rapid metabolism. Interestingly, the fainting episodes led to a diagnosis, revealing a typical symptom of this autoimmune condition and providing an unexpected insight into her health.
