Statement after attempt 1: My son began his journey to college. We packed both cars with all his belongings and drove to his college, which was three hours away. Being our first child to leave for college made it emotional, costly, and quite upsetting. It became even tougher for me when the check engine light in my car illuminated during the trip. I had to say goodbye at a gas station, which wasn't the best setting. We managed to cram all his items except for his bike in one car, and I turned back in case the car issue worsened.
