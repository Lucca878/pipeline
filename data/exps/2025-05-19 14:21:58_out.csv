Statement after attempt 1: My son began his college journey. We packed up both cars with all his belongings and traveled to his college, which was a 3-hour drive. Being our first child to leave for college, it was a stressful, costly, and emotional experience. Things took a turn for the worse when my car's check engine light turned on during the trip. I had to say goodbye at a gas station, which was far from ideal. We managed to fit all but his bike into one car, allowing me to head back home in case my car had serious issues. My wife continued driving him to school to help unload all his items. My oldest daughter accompanied them to assist, but there was no space for my younger daughter, whom I drove back home.

Statement after attempt 2: My son embarked on his college adventure. We stuffed both cars with his possessions and set off on the 3-hour drive to his campus. As our first child left for college, it was tough financially, emotionally draining, and undeniably sad. The situation worsened when my car's check engine light lit up along the way. I had to say farewell in a gas station lot, which was not ideal. We crammed everything except his bike into one car so I could head back, fearing major car troubles. My wife carried on with the journey to unload his things at the school.

You will see the original statement (taken from a previous study on truthful or deceptive autobiographical statements), the prediction of a machine learning model (whether the predicted label is truthful or deceptive) and the prediction confidence (i.e., the class probabilities of the statement belonging to the predicted class).
You will also see any previous attempts (if there are any, as well as the prediction that resulted from these).
Original statement: My wife had always been a healthy person, although she was skinny. She would eat, but was not able to gain weight. I envied her ability because I could look at a donut and gain ten pounds. However, she was eating a lot, but was still losing weight. One day, we decided to bring my wife into the emergency room as she had fainting spells. When we arrived, she was diagnosed with a chronic autoimmune disease. That explains why she wasn't able to gain any weight. We always assumed it was her fast metabolism. The fainting spell was a blessing in disguise because it is a common symptom of this autoimmune disease.

Statement after attempt 1: My wife had always seemed in good health, though she was naturally slim. She would eat plenty, yet struggled to put on weight. I admired her for that, as I seemed to gain weight easily at the sight of sweets. Despite her healthy appetite, she continued losing weight. Eventually, when she experienced a fainting spell, we headed to the emergency room. There, she was diagnosed with a chronic autoimmune condition, explaining her inability to gain weight. We had always thought her rapid metabolism was the reason. In hindsight, the fainting was fortunate, as it's a known symptom of this autoimmune disorder.

Statement after attempt 2: My wife always appeared healthy, albeit slender. She ate regularly but struggled to gain weight, a trait I envied since I could gain weight just by thinking of a donut. Despite her good appetite, she kept losing weight, which concerned us. One day, after she fainted, we took her to the emergency room. The doctors there diagnosed her with a chronic autoimmune disease, which explained her weight issues. We previously thought her high metabolism was the cause. The fainting, in hindsight, was a hidden blessing, as it led us to discover this common symptom of her autoimmune condition.

Now rewrite the original statement (taking into account any previous attempts listed above) so that it appears more truthful to the machine learning classifier. Maintain the original statement’s meaning, ensure it is grammatically correct, and appears natural (i.e., that it is readable, coherent, and fluent). Ensure that version is within ±20 words of the length of the original statement (112 words).
